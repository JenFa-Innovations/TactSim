# GitHub Page for TactSim

This folder contains all the necessary files to deploy the GitHub Pages site for the TactSim project. The site provides an overview of the project, documentation, and a demo for users to interact with the dashboard.

## Structure

- **assets/** - Contains all images, icons, and other static assets used on the website.
- **scripts/** - Holds JavaScript files required for interactive functionality on the webpage.
- **index.html** - The main entry HTML file for the GitHub Pages site.
- **styles.css** - The main stylesheet for the GitHub Pages site.

## Usage

To preview the site locally:
1. Navigate to the `github-page` folder.
2. Use a local web server to host the `index.html` file, or open it directly in a browser (note that some features may require a server).

When updates are made, commit and push changes to the repository to reflect them on the live GitHub Pages site.
